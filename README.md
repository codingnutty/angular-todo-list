####NRUTHYA's Todo-App

###My Project:
<p>
My project is a basic todo-list created using Angular.js without using a backend(i.e no database to store entries).
* One can post their todo item.
* scratch it off if it is completed by clicking a checkbox
* set its priority(normal-default, medium and high)
* move a todo item up or down.
</p>

###How it Works:
<p>
It works using magic that angularJS brings to HTML. Angular is a front-end javascript framework that helps you build a well-structured rich client-side applications in a modular fashion with less code and more flexibility. It extends HTML by providing directives that add functionality to your markup and allows you to create dynamic templates. It implements 2-way-binding, that connects the HTML(view) to javascript(models). This means that any update on your model will immediately reflect in your view without the need for any DOM manipulation or event handling. Angular also has a concept of directives that adds behaviour to your html code.
</p>
<p>
For Angular to work you only need to attach the angularjs link https://code.angularjs.org/1.4.5/angular.min.js inside of a script tag on the HTML page for it to be viewed locally without a server (just by opening the .html page).
</p>
<p>
In order to connect it to a backend and set up a server one can use npm (node package manager). npm uses package.json and bower.json to run install. and one can run the server using npm start and open <a href ="https://localhost:8000/app/"/>localhost</a> on your browser. NPM and Bower are both dependency management tools. npm is used for intalling Node js modules and Bower is used for managing front end components like html, css, js etc.
